    "### [1457. Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/pseudo-palindromic-paths-in-a-binary-tree)\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at least one permutation of the node values in the path is a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths going from the root node to leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: root = [2,3,1,3,1,null,1]\\\n",
    "Output: 2 \\\n",
    "Explanation: The figure above represents the given binary tree. There are three paths going from the root node to leaf nodes: the red path [2,3,3], the green path [2,1,1], and the path [2,3,1]. Among these paths only red path and green path are pseudo-palindromic paths since the red path [2,3,3] can be rearranged in [3,2,3] (palindrome) and the green path [2,1,1] can be rearranged in [1,2,1] (palindrome).\\\n",
    "Example 2:\n",

    "Input: root = [2,1,1,1,3,null,null,null,null,null,1]\\\n",
