    "**- Refers to simplifying a complicated problem by breaking it down into simpler sub-problems in a recursive mannar. While some decision problems cannot be taken apart this way, decision that span several pounts in time do often break apart recursively. Likewise, if a problem can be solved optimally by breaking it into sub-problems and then recursively finding the optimal solutions to the sub-problems, then its is said to have optimal substructure.**\n",
    "**- The basic idea of DP is to store the result of a problem after solving it. So when we get the need to use the solution of the problem, then we don't hvae to solve the problem again and just use the stored solution.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### There are two ways approach:\n",
    "- Top down: This is the direct fall-out of the recursive formulation of any problem. If the solution to any problem can be formulated recursively using the solution to its sub-problems, and if its sub-problems are overlapping, then one can easily memoize or store the solutions to the sub-problems in a table. Whenever we attempt to solve a new sub-problem, we first check the table to see if it is already solved. If a solution has been recorded, we can use it directly, otherwise we solve the sub-problem and add its solution to the table.\n",
    "- Bottom up:  Once we formulate the solution to a problem recursively as in terms of its sub-problems, we can try reformulating the problem in a bottom-up fashion: try solving the sub-problems first and use their solutions to build-on and arrive at solutions to bigger sub-problems. This is also usually done in a tabular form by iteratively generating solutions to bigger and bigger sub-problems by using the solutions to small sub-problems. For example, if we already know the values of F41 and F40, we can directly calculate the value of F42."
